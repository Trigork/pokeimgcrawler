# pokeimgcrawler
Bulbapedia Image Scraper
Requirements: python + scrapy (it may need additional libraries)

## How do I run this?
Clone the repo and run scrapy crawl pokeimgcrawler -o results.json
You can change the results file to whatever name/format you want
After crawling, there will be a imgs/full folder containing your downloaded images.

## Adjusting the range of images to download 
The tool doesn't accept parameters yet so you have to go into imagecrawler.py and change
the starting url to whatever pokemon you want to begin with and the stop number to the number
of whichever pokemon you want the crawler to stop at.
